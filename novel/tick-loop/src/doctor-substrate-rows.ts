/**
 * `@minsky/tick-loop/doctor-substrate-rows` — pure renderer for the 4
 * substrate rows added to `minsky doctor` in slice 1 of
 * `minsky-fresh-clone-health-checks` per `TASKS.md`.
 *
 * The existing 8 doctor rows (claude / pipx / mlx_lm.server / aider /
 * model weights / mlx-lm reachable / python / arch) report on the
 * **local-LLM stack**. The 4 new rows added here report on the
 * **install-time substrate** — the things that `pnpm install` puts
 * in place — so the operator can see *both* layers at once and
 * doesn't have to guess which layer is broken.
 *
 *   1. node_modules    (target: `<repo>/node_modules`)
 *   2. pnpm-lock.yaml  (target: `<repo>/pnpm-lock.yaml`)
 *   3. dist/index.js   (target: `<repo>/novel/tick-loop/dist/index.js`)
 *   4. pnpm on PATH    (`whichFn("pnpm")`)
 *
 * Each row is GREEN/✓ if present, RED/✗ if absent — when ANY row is
 * RED, doctor's banner becomes RED instead of YELLOW (operator can't
 * run the daemon at all without these). The renderer is
 * pure-over-state so we can pin the exact wording in tests; the
 * wiring in `bin/minsky.mjs` reads `existsSync` + `whichFn` to build
 * the state record.
 *
 * Pattern conformance (rule #8): Pure renderer — Hughes 1989.
 * Health-check distinction — Beyer et al., *Site Reliability
 * Engineering*, 2016, Ch. 6 (health checks must distinguish failure
 * modes the operator can act on from internal bugs; cryptic stack
 * traces conflate these).

 * the operator can spot at a glance which substrate piece is
 * missing.
 *
 * The recovery hint on each red row points at the canonical fix:
 *   - node_modules / lockfile / dist all → `pnpm install`
 *   - pnpm-on-PATH → one of {corepack enable, brew install pnpm,
